# Port AUTOSAR Driver for TM4C Microcontrollers

**Project Description**

This project involves the implementation of a full layered architecture model of the Port AUTOSAR Driver for TM4C Microcontrollers. The development of this driver is part of the Embedded Automotive 27 diploma program, conducted by Eng. Mohammed Tarek.

**Project Components**

1. **Microcontroller**: TM4C series microcontrollers.

2. **Port Driver**: The Port AUTOSAR Driver.

**Project Scope**

The project focuses on the development of a Port Driver following the AUTOSAR standard. The driver will interface with the TM4C microcontroller to provide port configuration and control capabilities. The driver will be implemented following a full layered architecture model, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

**Project Objectives**

1. Implement the Port AUTOSAR Driver for TM4C microcontrollers.

2. Utilize a layered architecture model to structure the driver code.

3. Provide port configuration and control functionalities in line with the AUTOSAR standard.

4. Ensure modularity and ease of maintenance in the driver design.

**Project Credits**

This project is conducted as part of the Embedded Automotive 27 diploma program with the guidance of Eng. Mohammed Tarek.
